# discord.js-forum-scraper
<p>project made by <strong>.mafelixos.</strong> for the anomic discord server to scrape user IDs for players who have gotten banned</p>
<small></small> This isn't foolproof, it's a starting point.It works by logging the user IDs of the authors of ban-appeal posts in the #ban-appeals forum channel on the Anomic Discord server. Although most people appeal their bans, many others decide to make their friend appeal for them instead, which can confuse.</small>
