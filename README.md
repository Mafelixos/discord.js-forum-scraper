# discord.js-forum-scraper
<p>project made by <strong>.mafelixos.</strong> for the anomic discord server to scrape user IDs for players who have gotten banned</p>
<sup>this isn't foolproof, it's a starting point. it works by logging the userid's of the author of a ban-appeal post in the #ban-appeals forum channel on the anomic discord server, although most people appeal their own bans, many others decide to make their friend appeal for them instead, which can cause confusion</sup>
